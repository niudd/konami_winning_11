The initial plan is to collect BGM of the japanese soccer game [konami winning 11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Evolution_Soccer). Of course, it won't be an easy job since there are 14 versions til now, and there are official versions as well as patched versions.
If it is possible, maybe it will also include more data, such as players' ability data, team ability data...

最初是在听到一个[实况足球](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%83%9C%E5%88%A9%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%BA%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%97)的BGM歌单时有了这个想法，从实况6开始玩了十几年，该给自己一个纪念了。计划按年份收集，包括各种补丁里的。如果有可能，希望能更详细地按年份整理其他数据，比如球员能力值、球队能力值等等。
